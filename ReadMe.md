Hi, I'm Rushi Kannan, a B.Tech student with a keen interest in Machine Learning, Signal Processing, and Artificial Intelligence. Currently, Iâ€™m working on a project aimed at using AI and signal processing techniques to help animals during disasters by detecting and analyzing their distress calls.

My project involves:

Collecting animal distress call data (audio files of animals such as elephants, monkeys, and crows etc...)
Collecting animal image data (image files of animals such as elephants, monkeys, and crows etc...)
Preprocessing the audio data using techniques like Fourier Transform and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)
Classifying the audio data using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and NaÃ¯ve Bayes to detect distress signals and deploy safety alarms for animals in disaster situations.
I believe that by integrating machine learning with natural sounds, we can make a meaningful impact on animal conservation and disaster management.

Data Used in the Project ðŸ“Š

Iâ€™m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and always open to learning new things.
